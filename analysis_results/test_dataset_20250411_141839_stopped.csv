"I live in a big town on the west coast, the Bay Area. When I go anywhere, people are reading their iphones and handhelds. It's almost comedic. Something Chaplin would satirize with brilliance. its a way of blocking out the real world. the screen becomes 'real' and 'life'. I wonder sometimes what happens to the mind when it is focussed on a li'l screen much of the day. what happens to the mind when all communication is broken into 140 word screeds. what happens when we become unaccustomed to each other. Social network seems a misnomer. I'd say to a degree these handhelds are an anti-social network.",handheld devices,AGAINST,social networks,AGAINST,
with regards to that first comment about putting grafitti on t-shirts. ugh. graffiti belongs to the streets. it's not supposed to be marketed and profited upon. it's like those jerks who throw in extras on skateboards into cereal commercials. corporations trying to tap into subcultures which they know nothing about.,graffiti on t-shirts,AGAINST,graffit,AGAINST,
"This is so incredibly presumptuous and racist. Ms. Lee actually thinks she represents and can speak for all Asians. There are many Asians who do not go to Chinese schools or Korean schools after school, and whose parents are at best middle class. I see plenty of Korean store owners who do not seem like people who went to college. And what about whites? AA affects middle class whites every bit as much as Asians, if not more. What a ridiculous presumptuous argument.",Ms. Lee's argument,AGAINST,stereotype,AGAINST,

An experience similar to Ms. Jackson's at CVS highlighted the degeneration of mathematical facility in young people. My bill at a fast food restaurant came to $10.15 and I handed the young lady behind the register $20.15. She looked at the 15 cents and at me all puzzled; she shuffled it around the counter. Then she entered $20.15 into the register and when it showed that the change due was $10.00 her face lit up. The mystery puzzle was solved. She looked at me with an awe that reflected her amazement that I could think of this ingenious gambit. Needless to say I was also amazed. I am similary awed when I read of surveys wherein significant numbers of college students (even in Southern California) could not identify a country that borders the U.S. or did not know which side the U.S. fought on in WWII.,ERROR,"API Error during send: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

"The game I grew up with and today's game are very different. In 1957 there were 8 teams, 11 players on each team, a total of 88 players in the entire league. Basketball was more a team game then, Bill Russell started his unbelievable streak, 13 seasons, 12 trips to the finals, 11 championships. Dribbling was done with the palm down, if Michael Jordan were magically transported back to 1957, he would have been called for palming the first time he touched the ball. The reason players today are able to drive so quickly is guiding the ball with the palm up, pushing the ball forward. Watching the Knicks of Reed and Frazier was a concert of 5 men working together,, moving the ball to the open man, constantly moving. Today 4 guys stand and watch an Anthony or James drive past their defender in an isolation play. Returning to the point, watching a 6'3"" guard dunk cheapens the shot, raise the basket 1 foot and the shot will regain the importance when Wilt Chamberlain the down a monster dunk.",ERROR,"API Error during send: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
