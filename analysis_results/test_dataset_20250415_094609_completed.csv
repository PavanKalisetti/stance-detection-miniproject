"I live in a big town on the west coast, the Bay Area. When I go anywhere, people are reading their iphones and handhelds. It's almost comedic. Something Chaplin would satirize with brilliance. its a way of blocking out the real world. the screen becomes 'real' and 'life'. I wonder sometimes what happens to the mind when it is focussed on a li'l screen much of the day. what happens to the mind when all communication is broken into 140 word screeds. what happens when we become unaccustomed to each other. Social network seems a misnomer. I'd say to a degree these handhelds are an anti-social network.",LLM_ERROR,Unexpected error: module 'google.generativeai' has no attribute 'config',social networks,AGAINST,
with regards to that first comment about putting grafitti on t-shirts. ugh. graffiti belongs to the streets. it's not supposed to be marketed and profited upon. it's like those jerks who throw in extras on skateboards into cereal commercials. corporations trying to tap into subcultures which they know nothing about.,LLM_ERROR,Unexpected error: module 'google.generativeai' has no attribute 'config',graffit,AGAINST,
"This is so incredibly presumptuous and racist. Ms. Lee actually thinks she represents and can speak for all Asians. There are many Asians who do not go to Chinese schools or Korean schools after school, and whose parents are at best middle class. I see plenty of Korean store owners who do not seem like people who went to college. And what about whites? AA affects middle class whites every bit as much as Asians, if not more.

An experience similar to Ms. Jackson's at CVS highlighted the degeneration of mathematical facility in young people. My bill at a fast food restaurant came to $10.15 and I handed the young lady behind the register $20.15. She looked at the 15 cents and at me all puzzled; she shuffled it around the counter. Then she entered $20.15 into the register and when it showed that the change due was $10.00 her face lit up. The mystery puzzle was solved. She looked at me with an awe that reflected her amazement that I could think of this ingenious gambit. Needless to say I was also amazed. I am similary awed when I read of surveys wherein significant numbers of college students (even in Southern California) could not identify a country that borders the U.S. or did not know which side the U.S. fought on in WWII.,LLM_ERROR,Unexpected error: module 'google.generativeai' has no attribute 'config',mathematical declline,AGAINST,
"The game I grew up with and today's game are very different. In 1957 there were 8 teams, 11 players on each team, a total of 88 players in the entire league. Basketball was more a team game then, Bill Russell started his unbelievable streak, 13 seasons, 12 trips to the finals, 11 championships. Dribbling was done with the palm down, if Michael Jordan were magically transported back to 1957, he would have been called for palming the first time he touched the ball. The reason players today are able to drive so quickly is guiding the ball with the palm up, pushing the ball forward. Watching the Knicks of Reed and Frazier was a concert of 5 men working together,, moving the ball to the open man, constantly moving. Today 4 guys stand and watch an Anthony or James drive past their defender in an isolation play. Returning to the point, watching a 6'3"" guard dunk cheapens the shot, raise the basket 1 foot and the shot will regain the importance when Wilt Chamberlain the down a monster dunk.",LLM_ERROR,Unexpected error: module 'google.generativeai' has no attribute 'config',modern basketball,AGAINST,
"Having lived since 1980, I know that Iran will always be a threat to all peace-loving people. I stand ashamed of Those Who Mean So Well who have bought into the unicorn scenario. Iran means to kill every non-Shia believer to the ocean - both oceans. They want John Limbert dead six times over as well as his family, friends, and dog.

"I could not agree more, having lost friends and family members to addiction. This is not as some believe a violation of civil liberties--no one is less free than the addict. Tom, this ""mere injection of a substance"" as you put it destroys lives, turns people into into monsters who literally steal from their own families. I have seen so many people end up in prison or die from this. You can't imagine the helplessness of family and friends as they watch someone fall prey to addiction, powerless to intervene. I'm no fan of the prohibition of soft drugs but in the case of opiate, crack, and meth addiction, *enough.*",LLM_ERROR,Unexpected error: module 'google.generativeai' has no attribute 'config',treatment,FAVOR,

I have been angry for many years that most scientific breakthroughs are the result of Federal funding but the US Gov't and Taxpayers are never patent holders.

"I am extremely grateful for the moderators at NYT, and I shudder to think of the things they must have to read through. The NYT comments are the only ones I currently read. I follow many comment writers here, both agreeing and disagreeing with them. Some I look forward to, if only to have my own world view challenged. It would be too easy to read only those opinions that I share, and have myself devolve into a participant in the echo chamber that seems to feed too many steadfastly held beliefs out there. As for the anonymity, I never really thought that I might be hiding behind my user name. It goes way back to 1999 when I first subscribed. I am Tom Tyson, and I live in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

"Right on! The watchword for any business, restaurants included, should generally be ""the customer is always right."" This is especially true with regard to tastes, and appreciation of flavors. People do not all experience the same food the same way and for an egotistic chef to imagine he has the right to determine how much salt should be put on something is ridiculous. The chef doesn't know best for everyone. So keep the salt and pepper shakers. They are the ubiquitous best flavor enhancers around--the very reason they are ubiquitous in any GOOD restaurant IMHO!",LLM_ERROR,Unexpected error: module 'google.generativeai' has no attribute 'config',a place at the table,FAVOR,
