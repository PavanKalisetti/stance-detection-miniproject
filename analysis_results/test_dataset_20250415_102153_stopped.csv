"I live in a big town on the west coast, the Bay Area. When I go anywhere, people are reading their iphones and handhelds. It's almost comedic. Something Chaplin would satirize with brilliance. its a way of blocking out the real world. the screen becomes 'real' and 'life'. I wonder sometimes what happens to the mind when it is focussed on a li'l screen much of the day. what happens to the mind when all communication is broken into 140 word screeds. what happens when we become unaccustomed to each other. Social network seems a misnomer. I'd say to a degree these handhelds are an anti-social network.",handheld devices,AGAINST,social networks,AGAINST,

There are many Asians who do not go to Chinese schools or Korean schools after school, and whose parents are at best middle class.

What a ridiculous presumptuous argument.",Ms. Lee's argument,AGAINST,stereotype,AGAINST,
