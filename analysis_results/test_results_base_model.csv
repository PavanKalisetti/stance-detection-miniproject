An experience similar to Ms. Jackson's at CVS highlighted the degeneration of mathematical facility in young people. My bill at a fast food restaurant came to $10.15 and I handed the young lady behind the register $20.15. She looked at the 15 cents and at me all puzzled; she shuffled it around the counter. Then she entered $20.15 into the register and when it showed that the change due was $10.00 her face lit up. The mystery puzzle was solved. She looked at me with an awe that reflected her amazement that I could think of this ingenious gambit. Needless to say I was also amazed. I am similary awed when I read of surveys wherein significant numbers of college students (even in Southern California) could not identify a country that borders the U.S. or did not know which side the U.S. fought on in WWII.,U.S.,FAVOR,mathematical declline,AGAINST

Dribbling was done with the palm down, if Michael Jordan were magically transported back to 1957, he would have been called for palming the first time he touched the ball. The reason players today are able to drive so quickly is guiding the ball with the palm up, pushing the ball forward.

"Legalising prostitution is only the beginning of a long process of emancipation. Succesful emancipation can not develop without legal acces to legally regulated prostitution; but very important is a process of cultural acceptance. As long as prostitution is looked down upon, full emancipation will remain impossible. But breaking down the illegality of prostituion is a vital pre -condition. I know the legalisation effects (of prostitution) in the Netherlands rather well, and believe me, after legalisation the complex problems related to low social status of the profession are not over.

"Glad Ms Grace is no longer associated with the Medicaid Commission.

Must be one of those ""social welfare"" groups organized to attract tax deductible funds for GOP causes. The Manhattan study focuses only on premiums and not total HC cost. Since the actuarial value is increasing from 45% today to 80% (% of premiums paid in claims) in the individual market, its going to be a better deal by definition. Mr. Roy forgot to mention that. The young male premiums before subsidy go up so much because they are offsetting higher premiums traditionally paid by women in the ""free market"" because they have babies, even though it usually takes two. And younger people are paying more to reduce the age penalty as they get older, much like we do for Medicare.

No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well.

Obesity causes heart problems, diabetes onset, fallen arches (not a lightweight disability), and a variety of other problems.

Harsh as it may be, companies probably do not hire obese people if they can find a way not to. FYI: obesity does not mean plump or overweight, it means debilitating obesity. How does an obese truck driver get into the cab of his truck? At some point, he can't. How does an obese service technician get down the basement stairs in an old house? At some point he can't, especially if he is carrying his tools. And, when does an obese employee become diabetic, with all attendant problems, e.g. dead tissue on feet.

""Excessive dog breeding, ear cropping and tail docking are more abusive than declawing a pet cat"". Clearly the author doesn't understand what goes on in a declaw surgery. They're amputating the toe completely so the cat has to walk on the phlanges that are NOT meant to be completely weight-bearing. A dog getting its ears or tail docked I agree is cruel but nowhere near worse than a cat being declawed. Last time I checked a dog's tail and ears aren't what bear all of their body weight when standing. Not to mention the ears are soft tissue that heals over time and has nothing to do with the dog's skeleton. The tail does involve the skeleton but would not have an effect on the dog's overall well-being once done. And excessive dog breeding? That has nothing to do with surgical procedures done on a dog or cat. That's a completely separate issue altogether. Ridiculous article.",declawing a pet cat,AGAINST,cat declawing,FAVOR

I don't know if it is ever truly ethical to affect a person's long term health over a short period gain. The second problem I have with this doping issue is the unfair advantage it gives over other players. It is pretty clearly observed in the Olympics that very developed countries (USA, England, Germany, China, etc.) have funds to give a boost and every advantage possible to already talented athletes. It just seems to me that these drugs are something that would be more affordable and easier to monitor where money flows, creating an even bigger gap between economically advantaged players and those with less resources (even if they are physically on par to each other).

A convict is released, put on parole, satisfies the requirements, and is expected to become a normal member of society. But at the same time loses certain right that other citizens have. He/she is in effect no longer a whole citizen, even after having paid satisfied the conditions imposed by the court. So even though his behavior has been corrected he/she is treated as uncorrected. Worse yet, in many cases they can not get certain work, are relegated to the lower levels of society, yet expected to be productive. So what is the purpose of conviction and incarceration?

Besides being a tool for learning more in depth about a subject, a research paper teaches critical thinking skills. A good student should read and review relevant material if they are going to voice an opinion. Sure the internet makes it a bit easier to find information, but it is a double edged sword. Students must learn how to sort good sources from poor sources. They must learn to look at a writers or organizations credentials and decide if it is a qualified source.

Successive generations of nativists have frothed about Irish, Italians, Polish, Chinese immigrants coming to steal American jobs. Yet America has became a superpower in those years. So is immigration really killing the job market? Or maybe we should look instead at what's different now?
