"It is not 'appropriate' to teach creationism as a means for upholding the bible. This pre-supposes that the bible should be upheld in a literal sense. Many Christians object to this. More importantly, governments should not be in the business of upholding the Bible.

" Allowing creationism in schools would violate the separation of church and state A separation of Church and state necessitates that public schools not be a forum for upholding the validity or truth of certain faiths.

" Evolution is a theory that is supported at the micro level.  The macro level of evolution has a long way to go to provide proof, but there is enough work going on in this subject that links can eventually be found.  Creationism is also a theory based on faith, yes there are some historical evidence of links to the stories within the Bible, but that only proves that the Bible has some historical value and does not prove the Creationism theory.",Creationism,AGAINST,creationism,AGAINST,

" Creationism is scientifically testable. Some creationists have argued that 'creationism' is a theory consistent with the scientific method. The hypothesis it adopts is that God created 'the heaven and earth ...' some thousands of years ago, and that man did not ""evolve"" into his current state. Supporters of Creationism then cite supporting evidence for this theory.

"Attempts to conceal the creationism-evolution controversy from students are dogmatic promotions of evolution.

" Evolution is an observable fact - While creationists often attempt to describe evolution as merely a theory, this is not exactly the case. Observations that evolution does occur in nature makes the process of evolution fact. The only part of evolution that is ""theory"" is the explanation as to ""why"" it occurs. But the ""why"" has nothing to do with the simple fact that it does occur, a fact that leaves no room for creationism.

"Teaching the creationism-evolution controversy is important to student learning. - One of the greatest lessons that a school can teach its students is the ability to use their own logic and reasoning to develop an objective opinion of the world around them. By teaching creationism in the classroom, schools are broadening students' knowledge. It is possible to teach both creationism and evolution in the same school. The goal is to expose students to all widely held 'beliefs'. The path to understanding requires the teaching of both Creationism and Evolution.
