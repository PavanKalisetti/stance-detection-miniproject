# 1. Install transformers and a backend (like PyTorch or TensorFlow)
# pip install transformers torch # or tensorflow

from transformers import pipeline
import torch # Or import tensorflow as tf

# --- Your input data ---
# List of texts for which you want to predict stance
texts_to_predict = [
    "I strongly support the new climate policy.",
    "This regulation will harm small businesses.",
    "The report doesn't mention the economic impact.",
    # ... more texts
]
# Optional: If stance depends on a target, structure your input accordingly.
# Pipelines often expect single sequences, so you might need to combine
# text and target, e.g., "Text [SEP] Target" if the model was trained that way.
# --- --- --- --- --- ---

# 2. Load a suitable pipeline
# OPTION A: Generic Text Classification (might need label mapping)
# You'll need to find a model fine-tuned for a relevant task.
# Let's use a generic sentiment model as an example, acknowledging it's NOT stance.
# Replace 'distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english' with a STANCE model if you find one!
# Search Hugging Face Hub: https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-classification&sort=downloads&search=stance
try:
    # Try loading a specific stance model if available (replace with actual model name)
    # classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="model-name-for-stance-detection", device=0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else -1)

    # As a fallback/example, use a sentiment model
    print("Attempting to load a sentiment analysis model as an example...")
    classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model="distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english", device=0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else -1)
    print("Example sentiment model loaded.")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Could not load the desired model. Error: {e}")
    print("Please search the Hugging Face Hub for a suitable stance detection model.")
    # classifier = None # Handle error appropriately

# 3. Get Predictions (if a model was loaded)
if 'classifier' in locals() and classifier is not None:
    predictions = classifier(texts_to_predict)

    print("\nPredictions from BERT-based model:")
    print(predictions)

    # 4. Extract Predicted Labels (THIS IS THE CRUCIAL STEP FOR EVALUATION)
    # You would need to map the model's output labels (e.g., 'POSITIVE', 'NEGATIVE' or 'LABEL_0', 'LABEL_1')
    # to your stance labels ('FAVOR', 'AGAINST', 'NONE'). This mapping DEPENDS ENTIRELY
    # on the specific model you loaded and how it was trained.
    # Example (assuming sentiment model and mapping POSITIVE->FAVOR, NEGATIVE->AGAINST):
    bert_predicted_stances = []
    label_map = {'POSITIVE': 'FAVOR', 'NEGATIVE': 'AGAINST'} # *** ADJUST THIS BASED ON YOUR MODEL ***

    for pred in predictions:
         # Simple example mapping - needs careful adjustment for real stance models!
        bert_label = label_map.get(pred['label'], 'NONE') # Default to NONE if label unknown
        bert_predicted_stances.append(bert_label)

    print("\nExtracted Stance Labels (Example Mapping):")
    print(bert_predicted_stances)

    # 5. Evaluate these BERT predictions against ground truth (using the scikit-learn code from Part 1)
    # Make sure you have 'ground_truth_stances' corresponding to 'texts_to_predict'
    # print("\nEvaluating BERT model predictions:")
    # report = classification_report(ground_truth_stances, bert_predicted_stances, labels=labels, zero_division=0)
    # print(report)

else:
    print("\nSkipping prediction and evaluation as no suitable model was loaded.")
