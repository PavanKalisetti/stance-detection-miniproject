An experience similar to Ms. Jackson's at CVS highlighted the degeneration of mathematical facility in young people. My bill at a fast food restaurant came to $10.15 and I handed the young lady behind the register $20.15. She looked at the 15 cents and at me all puzzled; she shuffled it around the counter. Then she entered $20.15 into the register and when it showed that the change due was $10.00 her face lit up. The mystery puzzle was solved. She looked at me with an awe that reflected her amazement that I could think of this ingenious gambit. Needless to say I was also amazed. I am similary awed when I read of surveys wherein significant numbers of college students (even in Southern California) could not identify a country that borders the U.S. or did not know which side the U.S. fought on in WWII.,education,FAVOR,mathematical declline,AGAINST,30,0
"The game I grew up with and today's game are very different. In 1957 there were 8 teams, 11 players on each team, a total of 88 players in the entire league. Basketball was more a team game then, Bill Russell started his unbelievable streak, 13 seasons, 12 trips to the finals, 11 championships. Dribbling was done with the palm down, if Michael Jordan were magically transported back to 1957, he would have been called for palming the first time he touched the ball. The reason players today are able to drive so quickly is guiding the ball with the palm up, pushing the ball forward.

As an addiction medicine physician I think it would be worthwhile to force treatment on addicts if their use is a danger to self and others. I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere. Because there is an drug epidemic and that opiate overdose is the leading cause of death over motor vehicle accidents in young people in this country something must be done .

No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well.

"Among the many services that libraries have traditionally provided, perhaps the most important are access to physical copies of published works, and access to information. As the publishing industry transforms, not surprisingly the borrowing of physical books from libraries is likely to decline. However, the need for access to information is likely to grow. This access to information is provided not only by devices and infrastructure but also is supported by the library staff who provide invaluable assistance. They assist with the tools, and serve as guides and navigators around the rapidly growing sources and forms of online information. Looking further into the future, as educational institutions become transformed by the widespread availability of free online courses, and distributed learning becomes the norm, there is another potential role for libraries as learning centers. In this case the facility not only provides the access devices, but can also host tutors and local study groups.

"I think if doctors spent more than 5-10 minutes in a room with a patient, the patient would feel more comfortable that the doctor understand their history and symptoms adequately. Doctors must remember that most patients have no idea if a fever or rash is a simple virus or meningitis. I have found sites like Mayo to be very helpful in figuring out when not to call a doctor for my kids for various normal symptoms. Of course it would be best to check every time, but you can't make a doctor's appointment for every twinge. On the other hand, the internet was very helpful in successfully diagnosing myself with cholestasis during pregnancy, and my doctor was extremely reluctant to order the tests and it turned out I had it quite severely. While I am not perfect, I have experience reading journals and understanding statistics. Other people may not be as aware or able to understand trustworthy vs. untrustworthy sites.

"In our society, people have to be told that their coffee is very hot, or to remove the plastic wrap of something before eating. I can't imagine people having to be informed about this years ago. IQ tests college degrees do not mean anything if he/she wants to put their finger in an electrical socket to find out if it works. I would say people are more educated than a generation ago, but there is a huge lack of common sense today which unfortunately you can not teach. Other than protecting people from themselves by putting them in bubble wrap, I don't see a fix for that.",global warming,AGAINST,danger,AGAINST,50,100

"I think this is a brilliant essay on the validity of RBG's comments about Trump. To paraphrase Mr. Butler and conflate with a familiar quote: ""If not Trump, who? And if not now, when?"" There comes a point where decorum, protocol, and tradition have to get left at the curbside of history--if we're going to make any of our own, or have one to talk about in the future. That's what Ginsburg is saying, and that's what Mr. Butler has so eloquently defended.",trump,AGAINST,trump,FAVOR,100,0
"i vote no, the wife can hurt her husband in ways that will go unnoticed, there are those who still believe that a wife should remain in the background, that she is not the one running for office ... i very much like the president and will vote for him again ....i will add that the the only exception for me was hillary clinton, by far the smartest most articulate politician in recent memory!! more together and harder working, too.... in fact, i voted for clinton because of his wife but i know of those who voted against him because of his wife",same sex marriage,AGAINST,women in a relationship,FAVOR,40,0
"Discipline is the first thing that any school worth its salt needs to teach. It is most important to teach respect for others, particularly fellow students who are there to learn not to be disrupted and distracted by this sort of thing. Freedom has become a useless trope in our society because we attach no responsibility to it. Long ago when I was attending an excellent public school we students would not have tolerated a person like the one you describe and let me say we were a remarkably tolerant class.",discipline,FAVOR,personal responsibility,FAVOR,60,100

"There are two major points that bother me about the possibility of players legally doping themselves. The first one is that regardless of the control and vigilance exerted over the use of game enhancing drugs, there will always be secondary effects that will either affect the athlete in the sport or later, at home or over a longer period of time. I don't know if it is ever truly ethical to affect a person's long term health over a short period gain. The second problem I have with this doping issue is the unfair advantage it gives over other players. It is pretty clearly observed in the Olympics that very developed countries (USA, England, Germany, China, etc.) have funds to give a boost and every advantage possible to already talented athletes. It just seems to me that these drugs are something that would be more affordable and easier to monitor where money flows, creating an even bigger gap between economically advantaged players and those with less resources (even if they are physically on par to each other). Would games become even more a show of force between the haves and the have nots?",olympics,FAVOR,doping,AGAINST,0,0
