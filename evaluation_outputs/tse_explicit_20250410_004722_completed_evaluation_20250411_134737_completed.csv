"It is not 'appropriate' to teach creationism as a means for upholding the bible. This pre-supposes that the bible should be upheld in a literal sense. Many Christians object to this. More importantly, governments should not be in the business of upholding the Bible.

"The point of the debate is to set up a straw man, that the world was created in six days, that anti-Christians can knock down. The Bible doesn't stand or fall on that statement. Creationism doesn't stand or fall on that statement. God did not create the world in six days, but he did never the less, create it.",Six-day creation,AGAINST,creationism,AGAINST,,95,-4
" Allowing creationism in schools would violate the separation of church and state A separation of Church and state necessitates that public schools not be a forum for upholding the validity or truth of certain faiths. This does not necessarily mean that Christian faith and ""creationism"" should not be taught as subjects of interest in public schools.

" Evolution is a theory that is supported at the micro level.  The macro level of evolution has a long way to go to provide proof, but there is enough work going on in this subject that links can eventually be found.  Creationism is also a theory based on faith, yes there are some historical evidence of links to the stories within the Bible, but that only proves that the Bible has some historical value and does not prove the Creationism theory.",Evolution,NEUTRAL,creationism,AGAINST,,-4,-4
"Preventing creationism to be taught is not violating freedom of religion. Evolutionism is not a religion, and therefore renders this argument void.

" Creationism is scientifically testable. Some creationists have argued that 'creationism' is a theory consistent with the scientific method. The hypothesis it adopts is that God created 'the heaven and earth ...' some thousands of years ago, and that man did not ""evolve"" into his current state. Supporters of Creationism then cite supporting evidence for this theory.

evolution has never been proven and will never be proven because it never happened. on that note you also can't prove creationism ever took place because it just happened. there is nothing intelligent about the thought you evolved from hydrogen gas or any other non living thing.,Evolution,AGAINST,creationism,FAVOR,,-4,-4

"Teaching Creationism is in no way akin to child abuse. Does Richard Dawkins give any support for his claim? Any reason he believes this to be so? It is hard to refute an argument that states ungrounded opinion as fact, but even harder to take it seriously.

"Attempts to conceal the creationism-evolution controversy from students are dogmatic promotions of evolution. Not since blasphemy laws has competitive expression of thought been illegalized, and this is what evolutionists want to accomplish. This is evidenced by none other than the title of an evolutionist argument on this very page: ""Schools should not teach theories that are completely at odds with each other""

" Public opinion is unimportant to whether creationism belongs in science classes - Public opinion does not determine whether creationism qualifies as science. This is the primary question surrounding whether it belongs in the classroom, so public opinion should not have any place in this debate.

" You're right, there isn't a shred of positive evidence for creationism and creationists don't even try.  All they do is try to poke holes in evolution as if that does anything whatsoever to prove creationism is at all viable.  />   /> You have to remember that the majority of ""professional creationists"" are just shysters trying to make a buck out of people's religious gullibility.",Creationism,AGAINST,creationism,AGAINST,,-4,-4
"The problem with the Catholic Church is that it has been unable to disagree with any scientific theory ever since they got burned condemning Galileo. The problem over ID is more semantic than real. In   science   God is the Unified Force, ID is Chaos Theory.
