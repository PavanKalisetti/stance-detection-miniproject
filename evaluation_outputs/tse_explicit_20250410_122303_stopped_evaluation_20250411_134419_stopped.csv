"It is not 'appropriate' to teach creationism as a means for upholding the bible. This pre-supposes that the bible should be upheld in a literal sense. Many Christians object to this. More importantly, governments should not be in the business of upholding the Bible.

"The point of the debate is to set up a straw man, that the world was created in six days, that anti-Christians can knock down. The Bible doesn't stand or fall on that statement. Creationism doesn't stand or fall on that statement. God did not create the world in six days, but he did never the less, create it.",six-day creation,AGAINST,creationism,AGAINST,,90,100
" Allowing creationism in schools would violate the separation of church and state A separation of Church and state necessitates that public schools not be a forum for upholding the validity or truth of certain faiths. This does not necessarily mean that Christian faith and ""creationism"" should not be taught as subjects of interest in public schools.

" Evolution is a theory that is supported at the micro level.  The macro level of evolution has a long way to go to provide proof, but there is enough work going on in this subject that links can eventually be found.  Creationism is also a theory based on faith, yes there are some historical evidence of links to the stories within the Bible, but that only proves that the Bible has some historical value and does not prove the Creationism theory.",ERROR,"API Error during send: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

" Creationism is scientifically testable. Some creationists have argued that 'creationism' is a theory consistent with the scientific method. The hypothesis it adopts is that God created 'the heaven and earth ...' some thousands of years ago, and that man did not ""evolve"" into his current state. Supporters of Creationism then cite supporting evidence for this theory.

evolution has never been proven and will never be proven because it never happened. on that note you also can't prove creationism ever took place because it just happened. there is nothing intelligent about the thought you evolved from hydrogen gas or any other non living thing.,ERROR,"API Error during send: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
