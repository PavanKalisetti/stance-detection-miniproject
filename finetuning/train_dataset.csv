"The author's opinion of public transit in Los Angeles and San Francisco / Oakland / San Jos�� is dated. Both metro areas have good public transit, and getting better. Even if LA's is not currently much used by upper middle class riders, these are not the only people we care about. Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service ""doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas."" Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX. On the contrary, shifting intercity travel preferences has great potential, especially over time, to shift local travel preferences. Without knowing the author's work, I would further point out that Stanford's record on the study of high speed rail is weak, and that Stanford's professors have been numerous (if short-sighted) in protesting a high-speed rail service that they - probably mistakenly - see as negatively impacting their quality of life.

It is fairly obvious that their is a certain limit to which resources would be strained. But the focus is totally off. Poverty causes population growth, not the other way around.

Claiming that Assad and ISIS are both evil suggest a moral equivalence that is unjustified. Assad uses horrible means to stay in power but we should not forget that before the trouble started he was quite popular and many assume that he might win free elections. Daily life in peace under ISIS is fundamentally more troublesome. The trouble with expanding attacks on ISIS to Syria is that it gives Washington a role in the Syrian conflict. We may also see that once Washington starts bombing them many ISIS members will start to call themselves members of Al Nusra or some other Syrian rebel group. In my opinion the only way to go forward is to strive for an agreement between Assad and the moderate opposition. Until now the US has sabotaged such negotiations and supported those rebels who don't want to compromise.

Companies are taking few steps to protect themselves from having sensitive consumer information hacked because they have no obligation to safe guard that information and no liability if it gets stolen and used to the consumers detriment. Corporations always object to telling consumers the truth about anything from whether or not their food contains GMO to whether their personal information has been stolen by a hackers. The reason for resting disclosure is almost always: the danger presented by the hacking or the GMO. Is overblown or doesn't exist. I guess the idea is what you don't know won't hurt you. Of course we all know what you don't know can hurt you very badly. Corporations should be required to notify consumers immediately if their information has been stolen and should be required to provide protection to those consumers from identity theft and compensation if it does that includes any losses and the cost of cleaning up the mess. Until that happens companies won't do anything about real security for consumers' information.,sensitive consumer information,FAVOR

The children are allowed to run free until they act out in dangerous ways sometimes taking innocent lives along with them. Politicians respond by taking away my rights rather than educating parents. Stop making our whole society suffer because bad parents refuse to take responsibility for their own creations. If we were to start teaching parenting skills with the fervor of adolescent sports, we might actually make this a better world to live in. Stop focusing on the symptoms. Start doing something about the root cause. Hold parents accountable for the actions of their own children. This is simple logic. Until the root cause is addressed, our continued dysfunction is inevitable.",parent accountability,AGAINST

I smoked marijuana from August 1972 to November 1973, at first fairly rarely, eventually nearly daily, for a few weeks twice daily, then abruptly stopped completely for about two months, then smoked a few times a week for a couple months. I haven't smoked in since. These changes in usage had to do with availability and (mostly) social circumstances. (I didn't begin to crave it more; I gradually lost interest as the novelty wore off.) Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug; I smoked it alone just once in my life. I wouldn't even say that stopping and starting was easy; it was nothing whatsoever. I never encountered anyone at any time in my life who showed the slightest sign of being even slightly addicted. (I do know what addiction is.

Creating constant chaos in one way or another is how he's occupied the front pages worldwide--and has for months and no doubt will continue at least for the next four years. The scary feature of an addiction like that is that people who have it are unaware that's what's driving their behavior and their decision making. All they know is that intensity caused by chaos makes them feel alive and good and without it they feel bored and dark and depressed. Thus, I am personally concerned that this kind of psychological issue might drive Mr. Trump to make decisions and create foreign policy he might not otherwise. For example, moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would stir up all kinds of chaotic problems and fires that would have to be put out.

"The UC system was envisioned in the 1960's to admit 13% of California high school students. Today, in practice, approximately 9% are admitted. Some of the reduction in admittance rates results from the fact that a larger number of students from out of state are admitted in order to capture more revenue. Regardless of this student's grades or scores, the fact is that a very large number of highly qualified students are turned away from the UC system every year. The impact is serious--they attend lesser in-state schools, go to out-of-state public universities, or they attend private schools. The other in-state schools are less expensive, but do not provide the same quality of education. Out-of-state public universities and private schools cost much more money, making these options harder for students to pursue. This doesn't seem like a wise education policy.

Economic growth requires innovation, enabled through this kind of technologies. Innovation is an integral part of prosperity of an organization which cannot occur without embracing state of the art capabilities. One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined.

They all watched videos, listened to music, or checked email on their smart phones. Real-world encounters and conversations are how members of the opposite sex meet each other and build relationships. But if I see someone engrossed in facebook or instant messaging, no matter how attractive she is, I will simply assume she doesn't want to be bothered. These technologies are very chick and very smart, but what we are in denial about is that they work to inhibit real world communication between human beings rather than promote it. It is a means of shutting out the world.

If Jerusalem had been the capital of Israel for 3,000 years, then the Zionist dream of a new Israel in 1948 would have been mad, for such a state would have been in place for all of those 3,000 years. Until Israel acknowledges that its being is based on a colonialist venture in that the current borders of Israel did not surround an empty space but had been occupied as a non-Israeli entity for centuries, advocates like Mr. Cohen will be living in a fantasy world.

I've taken online courses and they were not well designed, flexible, or conducive to having a discussion. This holds true for a set of courses I took 5 years ago and for several I've taken in the last year. Having an on line course available in conjunction with a live course would be great.

It is ironic that France has accepted countless numbers of Moslems from North Africa and the Mid- East, some of whom turn out, themselves, to be intolerant.

This includes putting up with criticism of one's behavior, just as Charlie Hebdo made fun of what some Moslems were doing. (It does not include criticizing people for who they are.)

Second, I have heard about giant farms who receive huge subsidies all my life, so I presume it must be true, but it simply doesn't exist in the corn/soybean area I am familiar with. Third, there have been dramatic boom/bust cycles in crop prices the past few years, but this has been driven by speculators in the commodities markets, and currency manipulation (China). Fourth, farm products such as corn and soybeans are one of the few items that this country still exports in large amounts, so you had better be careful what you do.

"""Yes, let's make college admissions (and even private K- 12 school please) based more on socioeconomics than race."" Let's be honest, people who argue this have little or no interest increasing the number of black college students and graduates. They are quite comfortable with reduced enrollment that the University of Michigan has seen since the law banning race and gender based AA was imposed by Michigan voters. Rather, what drives the opposition to affirmative action is the notion that ONLY blacks (and some Hispanics) are getting more than their so-called fair share. What these folks conveniently ignore is that we have affirmative action for white people as well, in the form of legacy preferences. Michigan voters didn't include those in the ban, because of course it favors the children of college graduates who as a group are disproportionately white. My point is there's a great deal of hypocrisy in the 'class not race' argument. Opposition to affirmative action seems not to depend on what we think is the best way to alleviate the under-representation of non-white students at our universities, but on what race or gender you belong to.",college enrollment,FAVOR

The bile ducts had no stones and there was not ultrasound abnormality of the pancreas. She had done her internet research and was adamantly convinced that she should never have her gallbladder removed. She somehow learned from the internet that the gallbladder provides necessary vitamins and nutrients and it should not be removed. I am not a gallbladder surgeon and I explained to her how the stones in the gallbladder were the cause of her pancreatitis and the treatment and prevention of more attacks is to electively remove the gallbladder surgically. I explained that drug or diet treatment to dissolve her stones is not usually successful and that there is no absolute need to keep her gallbladder for nutritional reasons.

Citizenship takes the universal human sense of membership in a community, and association with persons one sees every day and interacts with in many ways, and extends it in the imagination to a much larger circle, the nation. Such 'imagined community' is valuable in spurring solidarity and shared commitments beyond the local, but it is also vulnerable to emotional intensification and mythomania. The historical record of peoples subject to intense nationalist feelings -- many European nations in the 19th and early 20th century, more recently Serbia and now, more and more, China -- has been one of war-making, aggression, and disdain for others.

A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination.

"Information has moved from print to digital. That does not mean it is free or that it is easily located. Stop equating libraries with print. The point of most libraries never was to serve as a storage space. Unless you are a librarian or work at a library, you probably don't realize that everything in a library, including computers, wifi, online journals, and ebooks, is there as a carefully curated collection created to meet the needs of the people who use it. What you do realize is that when you walk into a library, or go there online, you find what you need and don't need to think very much about how that happened.

"When I am confronted by religious practitioners passionately arguing for absolute religious freedom I have lately started to pose questions of them rather than argue. For example, how should we deal with a religious group that practices cannibalism? Among those societies that have practiced it, there has been a sacred and even reverential set of beliefs built around sharing in the admirable qualities of the person whose flesh is shared. Supposedly wine becomes blood and bread becomes flesh during Communion. I am met with incredulous stares when I mention this. It could never happen, I am told. When I press on further and ask about female genital mutilation, which IS practiced in certain cultural/religious cultures today, I am met with silence. My point is that there are limits to religious freedom even if we don't codify them. These limits seem to be that religious freedom ends when harm to others starts and no amount of sincere, passionate belief in some deity can overcome them. We know intuitively what we as a society are willing to accept and harming children is not among them. What we do to ourselves as adults is one thing.

The inter-African and Arab slave markets (exemplified by the famous slave market of Zanzibar) had in any case been the primary destination for West African slaves since time immemorial.

Once a monopoly is permitted it is no longer a typical corporations competing with others. It is by definition the only place that a consumer can turn for that product or service thus its power to abuse that situation is massive and must be strictly controlled. It's price structure cannot be allowed to be government only by the corporations interests and the way it conducts its business must be a matter of public scrutiny.

Claiming that Assad and ISIS are both evil suggest a moral equivalence that is unjustified. Assad uses horrible means to stay in power but we should not forget that before the trouble started he was quite popular and many assume that he might win free elections. Daily life in peace under ISIS is fundamentally more troublesome. The trouble with expanding attacks on ISIS to Syria is that it gives Washington a role in the Syrian conflict. We may also see that once Washington starts bombing them many ISIS members will start to call themselves members of Al Nusra or some other Syrian rebel group. In my opinion the only way to go forward is to strive for an agreement between Assad and the moderate opposition. Until now the US has sabotaged such negotiations and supported those rebels who don't want to compromise.

It is apparent that domestic politics has a far greater influence on this issue than any other foreign policy issue. In watching Obama's struggles with Netanyahu over the past few years, it is most striking that the leader of a foreign nation could come onto American shores and do and say the kind of things that Netanyahu has and get away with it. He can do this because he can draw on the support of a domestic constituency that Obama, apparently, cannot afford to alienate. Indeed, when we consider how much Obama has humiliated himself by backing down from his own stated positions, Mr. Miller's position becomes almost bizarre. Strong and inventive Presidents have been effective in the ME in the past, but their achievements have been limited and none had to operate in the kind of politically polarized domestic political environment facing Obama.",israel,AGAINST

The best American universities recognize that they are graduating multi-dimensional human beings. Nothing could be more destructive of our civilization than to graduate one-dimensional specialists. Today's political campaign, with its capture by extremist reactionaries of gullible voters undereducated for citizenship, demonstrates that we have an acute need for multi-dimensional education throughout our society.

But when they discontinued their part in the trade, and actively (in the case of Britain) sought to suppress it, there was an angry reaction from the indigenous rulers of West Africa, because slavery was the mainstay of their economies. The trade continued unabated (if perhaps less lucratively), as slaves were sold to the North African and Arab states, right up to the 1960s. The inter-African and Arab slave markets (exemplified by the famous slave market of Zanzibar) had in any case been the primary destination for West African slaves since time immemorial. So if there is to be compensation, perhaps it should come first from Ghana, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire and other West African countries....that is, from the descendants of those who sold so many of their so-called brothers and sisters into bondage, for as long as the rest of the world allowed it.",slavery reparations,AGAINST

In watching Obama's struggles with Netanyahu over the past few years, it is most striking that the leader of a foreign nation could come onto American shores and do and say the kind of things that Netanyahu has and get away with it. He can do this because he can draw on the support of a domestic constituency that Obama, apparently, cannot afford to alienate. Indeed, when we consider how much Obama has humiliated himself by backing down from his own stated positions, Mr. Miller's position becomes almost bizarre.

The potential for abuse of these ratings is not based on students unqualified to evaluate their teachers (false, anyone can distinguish a poor product from a quality one) but rather on the methodology of Rate My Professor and other similar sites. As mentioned by at least one commenter, ratings suffer from selection bias and from a failure to use common terms. Those with strong opinions for or against are more likely to evaluate an instructor and what raters see as strict or smart or easy or dumb is so subjective that any two raters may have opposite definitions of the same word used in a rating.

Moreover, vegans are especially careful about what they eat and pay much more attention to nutrition than ordinary Americans.

"""Do Immigrants Take Jobs From American-Born Workers?"" seems to imply those jobs belong to native-born workers by right. That's an interesting perspective, particularly given how America advertises itself as a meritocracy, where the jobs go to the hardest working and most skilled. Mr. Camarota is re-treading the same arguments raised by 19th century Know-Nothings. America has not imploded from immigration since then. Successive generations of nativists have frothed about Irish, Italians, Polish, Chinese immigrants coming to steal American jobs. Yet America has became a superpower in those years. So is immigration really killing the job market? Or maybe we should look instead at what's different now? Perhaps the more significant cause of the decline in employment opportunities is because jobs are being shipped to countries like China or Sri Lanka? Or perhaps it's because there is a lack in upwards social mobility through failing public education and rising costs of higher education?",the threat,FAVOR

"This article is not only misleading but really a flat out lie. Most condominium owners in NYC are not foreign billionaires, but average families trying to make a living like everyone else. Further more, condo owners pay a much higher tax than home owner do on similarly priced homes. This is because in NYC houses are assessed an the basis of their market value. Condos are assessed on their market values as commercial (ie. rental properties), which allows the city to arbitrarily assign a much higher value to condos, and therefore a much higher tax. For instance, right now, one can find a $550K house in St. Albans with taxes of $4972. per year and a $529k condo in Battery park city with annual taxes of $9000. This is despite the fact, that most multi unit condos use less city services, less space and less energy than a similar number of houses. Even if condo owners and developers get a tax abatement during the initial years, these expire and they end up paying substantially higher taxes overall.

The employers who hire undocumented workers place a burden upon the society to either condone what they are doing or to act against it. Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone. California's solution has been to try to be inclusive so that undocumented immigrants function in society mostly like everyone else without formally accepting the undocumented as legal residents but it's sidestepping the issue. The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled. Workers who are being exploited can do little about it unless they can force the employers on their own. We in California have not found an acceptable solution that can be relied upon indefinitely.,illegal immigrants,AGAINST
"So taxing capital gains is double taxing income? OK so why should a laborer be taxed on his income after the first year of his career? His income is taxed and what's left over, his gain, is reinvested as capital into his service business: food which maintains his strength, housing which provides the location of his enterprise and the sundry other expenses that maintain his life so that his business may continue. Perhaps it might even grow into a larger enterprise, a family with several lines of business. If corporations can be people can people not be businesses? Can it be argued that he does not have a service business? Can it be argued that food is not a necessary input to the continuation of his business?

Mosaic law allowed men to obtain divorces from their wives and remarry, but Jesus (who supposedly did not change one ""jot or tittle"" of the law) said that this was adultery in most cases. Clearly ""the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order"" in relationships within the Bible itself was changeable.

For example, how should we deal with a religious group that practices cannibalism? Among those societies that have practiced it, there has been a sacred and even reverential set of beliefs built around sharing in the admirable qualities of the person whose flesh is shared. Supposedly wine becomes blood and bread becomes flesh during Communion. I am met with incredulous stares when I mention this. It could never happen, I am told. When I press on further and ask about female genital mutilation, which IS practiced in certain cultural/religious cultures today, I am met with silence. My point is that there are limits to religious freedom even if we don't codify them. These limits seem to be that religious freedom ends when harm to others starts and no amount of sincere, passionate belief in some deity can overcome them.

(5) It allows children of illegal parents to qualify for the full array of US entitlements, that in most cases a legal immigrant family would not receive.

The studies to which you refer examine calorie restriction diets, which do not work because they induce a starvation-like state that leads to metabolic changes.

"I agree with Dr. Bauerlein. I am but one case study of what is probably a larger trend. I graduated with my B. S. in Computer Information Systems. But what I was really enthused about was literature and writing. So I took two years off from work to go into a Masters program in English. My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources. The best thing that my two years off gave me was the time to read the great works of Western culture. Unless things change in the humanities departments, I will advise my children to pursue their study of the humanities in their leisure hours.

The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years.

Perhaps the reason that there is no evidence, as you say, is because tenure free schools have not existed.

Teachers should serve the schools boards, and the parents associations, not themselves. The fact that an outspoken teacher may be fired could be a good thing. In higher education, where research is done, tenure certainly has a place. However, to get tenure, takes an awe inspiring mix of academic credentials, politics, and dedication. And it happens without a union. In secondary education, it takes virtually nothing as the teachers union strangles local governments.

The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary.

Nuclear energy only provides 8% of U.S. energy. We could easily conserve 8% and then begin the decommissioning of every nuclear power plant. Then we could take the BILLIONS and BILLIONS of dollars thrown at the nuclear industry and invest it in Renewable Energies like Wind and Solar Energy. Germany is HUGELY successful with Wind and Solar Energy. Germany has produced the energy-equivalent of 20 nuclear power plants (yes 20!!) with Solar Energy alone!

I can only be beautiful, really, if men deem that I am so. My physical beauty isn't really about me. And, it gets me nothing but your approval. Who says I need your approval?

Maybe because it was West Virginia, where mineral wealth had long been exploited by out-of-state corporations. These geology maors, who were preparing themselves with the scientific understanding to deal with mineral managements, were also intellectually engaged in a most vivid way with their classics and philosophy classes.

Immigrants are people and people are assets; they bring their creativity, energy, and culture to America for everyone's benefit. If that needs to be stated in terms one can measure with a dollar value, think of immigrants as sources of customer demand, stimulating employment. Immigrant-run restaurants and shops are a perfect example. Would native-born Americans be working at Chinese restaurants or Mexican bakeries if not for immigration? No, because those businesses wouldn't exist in the first place, and we'd all be worse off as a result.

Not only does the study of literature prompt students to critically analyze texts and articulate arguments in writing, it provides students with a more well-rounded and global view of a discipline that all too often focuses on old dead white British and American men. As a student of French I have had an enormous exposure to the cultural and political issues that dominate North African, West African, and Carribean peoples. Moreover, I have been fortunate enough to gain an understanding of the American immigration debate through the comparative study of Chicano/Chicana literature juxtaposed with the literature of North African immigrants in France. It would really be a shame to see this multifaceted and dynamic discipline disappear from some Universities because of uninformed notions that the study of French is nothing more than an American romanticization and fetishization of a European culture and language.",humanities programs,FAVOR

Moreover, I have been fortunate enough to gain an understanding of the American immigration debate through the comparative study of Chicano/Chicana literature juxtaposed with the literature of North African immigrants in France.

The teacher was able to provide enrichment lessons instead of focusing on their disruptive behavior. We parents were able to teach them self-control techniques.
